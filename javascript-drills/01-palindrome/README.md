# Palindrome

Palindrome's are strings that are the same forward and backwards. So, something like `raw war` is considered to be a palindrome. Write a function that checks to see if a given argument is a palindrome or not.

Questions that you should ask (not limited):
- case sensitivity? yes, sensitive
- string length limit? no upper bound on string length
- should we assume numbers as string?
- validation? i only care stuff that could be "stringable" and has some content
- return type? (obviously, a boolean)
